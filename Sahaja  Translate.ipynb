       "array([['1993-1011, TV Interview, Real Women, Part 1\\nTV Interview, \"real women\", part 1, Los Angeles (United States), October 11, 1993\\n[Voice off]: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, the most important spiritual figure in the world today. Please join us on a special\\nprogram of “Audrey Hope’s real women”\\nInterviewer: My name is Audrey Hopes and welcome to ‘Real women”. It is a great honour to be in the presence of the\\nmost important spiritual figure in the world today, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.\\nShri Mataji is a world leader and has travelled the globe many times over to give Self Realization to thousands.\\nSelf Realization is the pure connexion with our spiritual nature and is the only hope for a stable society. Today is that\\nday prophesized by the saints.\\nOnce you may have needed to travel to the Himalayas or to meditate on a mountain for twenty years, but now, through\\nthe grace of Shri Mataji, there is a simple way to achieve that connexion and that is through Sahaja Yoga. Shri Mataji\\nfounded Sahaja Yoga as a method for human beings to experience the truth within and to become your own master.\\nShri Mataji is a mother and a grandmother, a true role model for all human beings.\\nShri Mataji was a spiritual guide for Mahatma Gandhi. She accepts no money for Realization and she says the truth\\ncannot be paid for.\\nShe joins us after her fourth visit to the United Nations and before her journey to Washington DC.\\nShri Mataji is known all over the world. She is less known in the United States. Well, it is here, in the mist of media and\\nits power, where she is needed the most.\\nShri Mataji, we are deeply honoured to have you here, thank you.\\nShri Mataji: Thank you very much.\\nInterviewer: I’d like to begin by speaking about Self Realization and to tell the viewers what Self Realization is.\\nShri Mataji: Within yourself lies a power which is called in Sanskrit language as Kundalini, which is in the sacrum\\nbone. That means definitely, that the Greeks knew this was a sacred bone where that power was lying. This is the\\npower which connects you to the All-pervading Power.\\nNow the truth is that we are not this body, this mind, this ego, these conditionings. But you are the pure Spirit because\\nyou say: “My ego, my body”, you are the pure Spirit, this is one truth about yourself. Another truth is that there is the\\nAll-pervading Power of divine love. It’s called by various names. You see these beautiful flowers; it’s a miracle itself.\\nAnd who runs our heart? We never inquire, we don’t find by doctors will tell you it’s the autonomous nervous system.\\nBut who is this “auto”?\\nSo these two things we have to realize that we are the pure Spirit and there is an All-pervading Power of divine love.\\nPower of love, not of hatred.\\nInterviewer: How does one receive Self Realization? Does a person have to give up their personal life or self problems\\nbefore they can attain this?\\nShri Mataji: It’s very simple, that within our being, a complete machinery is already made through our evolutionary\\nprocess. And we have seven centres, main seven centres placed on our central nervous system, or we can call it on the\\nparasympathetic and ultimately, this power raises, penetrates through these six centres only, ultimately, pierces\\nthrough the fontanel bone area and connects you to that All-pervading Power.\\nWhile it is travelling through these charkas or the centres or the energy centres we can call them, it nourishes them.\\nNot only it nourishes, it integrates them and it enlightens them.\\nMost of the problems, global problems, are because of human beings. And most of the human problems are because of\\nthese centres. Because these centres cater to our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual needs. So once these centres\\nare out of gear, we have all these problems whether on an individual basis or on a collective basis.\\nSo when this connects to the All-pervading Power, then you achieve a new state of awareness. So there’s a\\nbreakthrough in your evolution.\\nEvolution process is spontaneous. We have not paid for it, we didn’t do anything, we are becoming human beings. So\\nnow, the last one, why should we pay for it? Or why should we do anything about it?\\nInterviewer: Does one need blind faith or can this be approached as you say, or how is it approached like a science?\\nShri Mataji: It’s just a living process. You try to understand this way, that this Mother earth is there. What we have to do\\nis to put one seed in it and the seed sprouts. How? Because it is built in, in the seed to sprout and built in, in the Mother\\nEarth to make it sprout. It’s as simple as that.\\nInterviewer: We Americans are very into scientific proof. [Laughter]\\nAnd you describe Sahaja Yoga as an essence of all religions and not just a religion. How is Sahaja Yoga different?\\nShri Mataji: “Saha” means “with”. “Ja” means born. Born with you is the right to have this union, the Yoga. That is\\nSahaja Yoga.\\nBy this union, you realize that all the religions were flowers born on one tree of spirituality. But we have plucked the\\nflowers and now we are fighting with the dead flowers. If there is one God then why could we-how could we fight in\\nthe name of God?\\nThis is the philosophy of Gandhiji also. We also followed the same philosophy not only but, as we worship all the\\nincarnations and all the prophets and all messiahs, in the same way, he said we have to worship them. It’s not just to\\nshow respect but you must worship the same way. That is Sahaj religion which encompasses all the religions and also\\nrespects because in essence all of them are the same. And if there is one singular message in all these religions is that:\\n“Seek your Self to be born again”. That’s the message in all the religions.\\nInterviewer: So where has the religion gone wrong? We are- let’s take Christianity for example.\\nShri Mataji: Christianity has gone wrong at a very early stage I should say, where it was taken over by Paul. I asked my\\nfather when I first saw his name in the Bible, I said: “Who is this Mister Paul?” He said: “He is a squatter. He had\\nnothing to do with Christ. He never met Christ. He had actually killed so many Christians, he has killed the disciple of\\nChrist called Steven. But being a bureaucrat, he thought it was a good platform to jump onto the platform of\\nChristianity. And he had to have help from somebody, one of the disciples. The worse disciple of Christ was Peter, so he\\ngrabbed Peter and has written the Bible”.\\nDespite all the things they have done, that Christ told Peter that “Satan will catch hold of you’ it’s clearly said. Now this\\nMister Peter and Mister Paul put together tried to spoil all the great work of our Lord Jesus-Christ because, first of all,\\nthe worst for women. Paul hated women from his heart. And that’s why even for Christ’s Mother, he uses a word like\\n“woman”. To us, she is a Goddess. She is a Mahalakshmi, to Sahaja Yogis. But to him, she was just a woman. And the\\nway he has conducted the whole thing has brought such a disaster on the women of the West. Even now, up till now,\\nwomen are treated as something very low for spirituality.\\nBut in India, a woman is the shakti, is the power. Another great mistake they have committed is in describing the\\nTrinity. We have God the father, God the son and the third one is a Holy Ghost, is a dove. How can you have a father\\nand a son and no mother?\\nBut there is a Primordial Mother which was accepted by all the religions even the Jews had it. Greeks called it Athena.\\n“Atha” in Sanskrit means “primordial”. Athena. In India, this is called as Adi Shakti. In every religion, they had this\\nMother who was the Primordial Mother.\\nSo he cancelled all the powers of a mother and that is how the women have a very inferiority complex, I think, or\\ninsecurity in the Western world.\\nBecause they think we have to, all the time, be apologetical [unsure] and we should always serve the men and we\\nshould sell our body, we should make ourselves very attractive, otherwise, we have no place! And that is how the\\nmorality of women is shattered.\\nInterviewer: I wanted to use a quote from that [pensée? French word?] in \"Timothy 1\" to really emphasise this point. It\\nsays in the Bible, “A woman should learn in quietness and full submission. I do not present a woman to teach or to have\\nauthority over a man; she must be silent. For Adam was formed first, then Eve. And Adam was not the one deceived; it\\nwas the woman who was deceived and became a sinner. [The New Testament, 1 Timothy 2:9-14]\\nShri Mataji: That’s also a mistake about Adam and Eve also. But that, I’ll deal later on. But a simple thing is that it was a\\ncomplete attack on womanhood. And that’s how women have accepted- imagine such a developed country like\\nEngland, was discussing till yesterday, whether a woman should preach or not.\\nYes! I mean, now, with great difficulty, some people have agreed that women should preach.\\nI just don’t understand. In India, a woman is very powerful. She doesn’t care for her husband if he goes after another\\nwoman. She says: “Alright, he’s sinful, let him go to Hell. I don’t care.” She stands on her own merit on her chastity. She\\ndoesn’t bother.\\nNow, the whole situation is so bad, that women have to be, all the time, trying to, you see, expose their body also. I\\nhaven’t seen a single film in which a man is exposed. It’s always the women [who] must be exposed as if men are some\\nSanctum sanctorum.\\nI feel the slavery of women is much more in the West than in India.\\nInterviewer: And how about the Koran? I’m speaking about the Iranians. I know you did a programme this week and it\\nwas a very important programme. And I’d like to talk about how the Iranian people have misinterpreted Mohamed and\\nthe effects on their society and the importance of their changing for women. [unsure]\\nShri Mataji: Yes. Even Muhammad Sahib, you see, he respected women so much. You know, they used to have wars.\\nThey were tribes. They were tribal people. It was only Muhammad Sahib who could take birth in those horrible Arabs.\\nAnd he found that so many men, young men were killed. So he said: “Alright. If there are not young men, let the old\\nmen marry, even young girl. It doesn’t matter but marry. Even if they have to marry five times, marry so that they do\\nnot become prostitutes. Just to respect their chastity he prescribed this thing but it is not compulsory that you should\\nmarry five times. You see, we have horrible things in India. A man marries four times, has eight children each time\\nbecause they believe that but that democracy [demography?], they’ll be powerful.\\nThen, after some time, they divorce their wives by saying three times: “Talaq, talaq, talaq.” [repudiation].\\nNow, these women are with so many children, are just left on the street. And if you see them you’ll think that this is\\nworse than Somalia.\\nHe respected women! Not only, he told his wife that: “You are going to work out- Aicha” he told her: “You are going to\\nwork out something against the religion.” And really it was wrong on her because his own daughter, as you know her\\nname was Fatima, stood up and said that: “This, never Muhammad Sahib has said it.” But this Abu-Bakr is a fellow who\\njust took the platform, as it is, I should say, instead of his own son in law, Hazrat Ali, who was a great Realized soul. And\\nhe just completely changed the ideas about women which Fatima was going to tell.\\nSo there were big wars called Karbala in which two children of Fatimabi were killed, Hazrat Ali was also killed and\\nthere two groups which were formed, one is Shia and Sunni.\\nBut Shias also don’t understand that they have to respect their women because Fatimabi herself was a, not only a saint\\nbut an incarnation. She was a Goddess.\\nInterviewer: How has the media affected our view of women today?\\nShri Mataji: In the Western media I must say that women are used just to lure or some sort of a very low type of human\\nbeings I should say. Men are not sex points. They are the Spirit. They are reduced to this sex point by Freud. And Freud\\nwas like a Christ here once upon a time. Now of course, after so many years, I said this at least twenty years back. But\\nnow it is appearing, many- I’ve seen some books like “Fall of Freudian Empire” “Freudian Freud”, so many books are\\ncoming now! Already all the harm has been done! Human beings are reduced to a sex point now by media and women\\nwho are very cheap who can expose their body and can sell their chastity are regarded as great heroines. This is what?\\nIt’s the situation of the media that is today.\\nInterviewer: I heard you have even said that Freud can only prosper in America.\\nShri Mataji: Hum?\\nInterviewer: Freud can only prosper in America.\\nShri Mataji: Yes.\\nInterviewer: You said that.\\nShri Mataji: It’s a fact.\\nHe was born in Austria and when I talked against Freud they all clapped. They were very happy I said so because they\\nwere quite ashamed about him. But even in Austria, you find so many prostitutes on the streets, standing all the while.\\nBut here, at least, there it is, the housewives are housewives.\\nHere, even housewife has to dress up in such a way that she should be like a prostitute. Why should you do that? You\\nmust have your self-respect.\\nInterviewer: How is this special time for women?\\nShri Mataji: I call it this a Blossom time because I say they are many flowers, so many some of them are on the Earth\\nand they are to become now fruits. But it’s called as Qiyamah in the Koran, meaning the Resurrection time.\\nEven in the Indian scriptures, we have this Resurrection time and by many astrologers, thousands of years back, it was\\npredicted that such and such time will come. And also in the Bible, it is the Last Judgement.\\nThere’s another stupid idea which we find in Bible and also in Koran, which is very stupid, and I think also- I don’t\\nknow about the Torah, but they said that there is also the same idea previously – that, at the time of Resurrection our\\ndead bodies will come out of the graves and then they’ll ascend. Now, tell Me what is left in the grave of the dead\\nbodies? It is so absurd, it’s so illogical.\\nActually, in that way, I would say Indian scriptures said the correct thing that at this time of Kali Yuga all the souls\\nwhich are lost, all the souls who want their Realization, all the souls who have been thinking of God and seeking God all\\nover the world, will be reborn. That’s why we have a population problem. That is why all kinds of horrible people are\\nalso born. In this time, about twenty years back, your media was much better. They didn’t show such horrible scenes. I\\nmean they must show bedroom’s scenes, what is the need? Bathroom scenes. I mean, if somebody comes into your\\nhouse, do you take them to your bedroom, into your bathroom or you keep them in the dining room? I mean, it’s\\nprivate life. They have no respect for privacy.\\nNow, you see, this kind of funny idea that we are going to get out of the graves and all that is still lingering in the mind\\nof many ignorant Christians and also Muslims. One Bosnia fellow met Me, he was Muslim. I asked him: “Why were you\\ndying there, what was the need to die?” He said: “Because if we die now in the name of God, we’ll be resurrected.”\\n[Interviewer is laughing.]\\nShri Mataji: I mean it is relevant from the idea of Bible, you see? So this is what it is that these ideas are to be put right.\\nIn the west, you see, we have Christianity, we have other religions. But, I would say that the roots of the spiritual\\nknowledge, it’s more in India. I’m myself born in a Christian religion. But the roots about it, the explanation about it, is\\nmuch better discovered in India because it’s an ancient country which has been all the times seeking, seeking, for\\nthousands of years.\\nNow the system that is Sahaja Yoga as you mentioned is not mine. It’s an ancient system. But we had this system in the\\nNath Panthis, they call it, that they were in the centre. And one master will have only one disciple, this was the\\ntradition. So there were very few people who got their Realization. Shri Rama’s father-in-law’s guru was Ashtavakra.\\nHe has written about sahaj. But he has just described what happens when you get into the state of Spirit. This\\nfather-in-law, Janaka, gave Realization to only one person Natchiketa according to the tradition.\\nBut, on the twelve century, there was a great poet in India, in Maharashtra, born as Gnyaneshwara, who asked his\\nguru, his own brother that: “Let me also tell about this.” He said: \"All right”. He permitted. So in his Gnyaneshwari\\nwhich is just the explanation of Gita, he has clearly said in the sixth chapter about Kundalini, how she rises, how she\\ngives you Realization and everything. But those people who were in charge of religion, as usual, didn’t know how to do\\nit. So what they did, they said:” This is \"nisidhat\" [forbid] - means, cancelled- you don’t read this sixth chapter.” So\\nnobody would read that chapter. That’s how it went into background!\\nSo I would say, after that, many great saints like Guru Nanak, Kabir, Sukarama, Ramdas, in the sixteen century, did a\\ngreat work of Kundalini [inaudible]. Even in the Bible, it is: “I will appear before you as tongues of flames.” “Tree of\\nlife” so many things are described!\\nBut in the little time that they had, they could not explain so much. Now, these people have talked about Kundalini and\\nsaid about it. If I have done any work, is this, that by studying through human beings, I met many people because my\\nfather was a very social man and my husband was in a position where I met many people. I studied human beings and\\nI found out a method by which you can now give a-mass Realization.\\nIn Russia, in Bulgaria, Romania, we always have people in the stadium, not less than sixteen thousand, and they all get\\ntheir Realization! And they are very sensitive to spirituality and they stick to it. None of these false gurus could stick\\nthere.\\nInterviewer: Psychics, the issue of psychics, it’s so popular here! And we are very-it’s very dangerous. Could you\\nexplain what can happen?\\nShri Mataji: Ah. Americans are very simple people I must say. First time I came for parapsychology, they took Me into a\\nhall of parapsychology. They told Me: \"You are dealing with dead spirits!\" And they were very angry with Me. He says\\nthat: \"You come as guest and why do crusade? [unsure].\" I said: \"I have to tell you the truth, I am your Mother. I’m not\\nyour guest, you didn’t pay for Me. I came on my own, coming on my vehicle and going on my vehicle\", while they made\\nmoney out of Me. So, they don’t like it.\\nWhen I first came here, when I told them that: \"These are all spirits and psychic things and don’t do it”, they didn’t like\\nit.\\nInterviewer: How can we know of false guru?\\nShri Mataji: First of all, you cannot pay for your Self Realization! Or for any knowledge. You must value your life. If you\\ndon’t value your life, then you’ll go to all such stupid people and you’ll waste your time. No, if you value you life, if you\\nvalue your money for example, you’ll first find out what it this you are buying. First of all you must see the disciples,\\nwhat are they doing, what is their style what are they gaining, what is their knowledge. First the disciples! Most of them\\nare recluses.\\nAnything which is sort of fashionable, people want to do. You talk of individuality, all right? Any entrepreneur, now\\nthey just started a six inches of skirt, everybody wears six inches of skirt! Otherwise you are not “in”, means in the\\nlunatic asylum.\\nSo like that, these people are good at big advertisement, marketing, writing books, all falsehood! You believe them\\nbecause they have a knack, advertisement is the main thing which has led to this kind of things and Americans are\\nreally very sensitive to advertising. If anything is advertised, they think it’s great.\\nAlso I was surprised when I came here, they asked Me – in Boston, I remember- they asked Me: \"How many Roll Royce\\nyou have?\", in the television. I said: \"I don’t have!\" They said then: \"You don’t make any money.\" \"No.\" I said: \"I don’t\\nmake any money.\" \"So there’s no business.\" \"No\", I said \"no\". \"Then we are not interested.\" They wouldn’t have Me on\\nthe television. I mean you are so money oriented that tomorrow you’ll purchase God also I think.\\nSo, first of all, you cannot pay for it.\\nSecond, you must see the disciples, what sort of disciples they are, what they are, how much they are talking about the\\nknowledge. They must have the knowledge. Now you know very well, and people can find out that in Sahaja Yoga\\npeople just get Realization and start giving Realizations to others. So many diseases have been cured. It’s a fact, there’s\\na book written.\\nInterviewer: So we are in a new stage, a new evolution.\\nShri Mataji: Of course, this is the time, if you miss it, you’ll miss it for ever! Because, you see, otherwise, you see in\\nAmerica, people are getting destroyed from within. All kinds of diseases, psychological problems, this, that, stress, this,\\nthat, all kind of things are going on.\\nNow, to stop it, better ascend above all these things.\\nInterviewer: Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.\\nPlease join us for part two of this special program on “Audrey Hope’s real women”.\\n',\n",

    "Shri Durga Mahakali Puja, Paris (France), 25 July 1992.\n",
    "Today’s Puja we have arranged of Durga or the Kali. That is the destroying form of the Goddess of all the evil and negativity. This we had to do it in France, because I feel very strongly that day by day, in general, France is going down and down and down. While you people are coming up, the rest of the France is in the most pitiable condition. Firstly, as you understand, is the Catholic church, which – perhaps you are not aware of, perhaps maybe – because you don’t read any other languages, you just read French compulsorily by this country. So you have no international views or international news that this Catholic church has done so many horrible things in the past, that is unbelievable that they have anything to do with God. They burnt many cardinals in the heart – roasted them.\n",
    "Not only that, they killed so many people who ever tried to utter a word about them. They were much worse than Muslim people. They went to other countries like South America, America – all these places they’re all Catholics – even our country. And they killed millions and millions of people.\n",
    "Now as this is Kruta Yuga that has started, one of the things as I said yesterday is that: you will have to pay for whatever you have done, on mass scale or individual scale. If that is the case, then one must know that France has to pay a lot and this Catholic church has to pay more. Catholic church has just taken out yarns out of their heads and started a theory of original sin. That’s how to condemn every other Incarnation, every other Prophet – that they were all with original sin. And even they said Mary was born with original sin, for many popes they were discussing it.\n",
    "This shows that this whole hocus-pocus religion of Catholic church had to establish itself by forcing people, by torturing them, by taking all their ideas into their own control, give them funny ideas like original sin. Another is that you must confess, giving them the left Vishuddhis. They treated women as nothing and to Mother of Mary they called Her a woman. And this Paul, as I told you yesterday, is a fact.\n",
    "Now it’s necessary for Sahaja Yogis to understand how this Catholic church is so dangerous and has been doing such harm. As there has been so many books about it – that you people don’t read, because it’s not in French. There are English books from America – you must learn English. It’s very important now I feel, that all the French must know English, they must read English. French will not give you the international personality that you are supposed to acquire. You had some scholarship, not much. The real scholarship comes from England and also from America in English language, and also from India. One gentleman who tried to translate all these things in UNESCO, he was thrown out by your media. Your media is taking full advantage that you don’t read any other newspapers; they are doing whatever they feel like. All kinds of scandals, all kinds of sensationalization – whatever they want to write, they write in free press. On one side there’s suppression of natural life of human beings, let them to go to Freud. Freud is the dirtiest man you can think of, who has put his ideas into your head. But as if you are already brainwashed people that you accepted all that. How could you accept Freud? If Freud had come to India, they would have killed him in no time! What happens is that, somehow or other – I don’t know what is the reason, I don’t know where to place it, but the wisdom is not there. There is no maturity, there is no wisdom. America I can understand because it is only two-three hundred years old. But what about the French? They have not been able to mature but they have become extremely frivolous. Maturity is finished.\n",
    "One of the reasons could be that they want that you should be always young. In India, young people are called as stupid: you call it gadha pachisi, means in 25 years they are donkeys. They are never regarded as sensible people to be followed. And gradually by this movement from Catholic church to Freud, what has happened that you haven’t got your own personality to understand what is right and what is wrong. Of course I must say Sahaja Yogis must have done lots of punyas and must be very courageous people to be born in this country. Otherwise I don’t know how you could have taken your birth here. The law is so funny that they said it depends on the mood of the magistrate. (Shri Mataji laughing) You see the magistrate doesn’t know the law. Such a stupid country in modern times I’ve never known. Nowhere in the world there’s such a stupid law as it is here. Of course in America, there is no justice, they do what they like. But here is so-called modern people. What is their condition is that they have no sense of law. If you ask them, “What is the law?” They don’t care. It’s the mood of the magistrate. Now supposing he has had a big drink in the last night, second day he comes with a hangover, so finished. And then he will be very much biased towards the drunkards only.\n",
    "So here it is becoming such a horrible society that Indians would be shocked, beyond doubt, but nothing but prostitution. To see and to be seen. Why? Every woman has to dress up in such a way that she should be attractive, for what? Is she a prostitute? All kinds of bathroom cultures developed. For example French bath, you know what it means, all over the world. It’s a very dirty habit of laziness, it comes because of drinking. If you drink too much, next morning you are so lethargic that you take just a French bath and go.\n",
    "So, please try to remember as French Sahaja Yogis, that your task is much more difficult than the task of other countries, because it lacks complete wisdom. Neither you’ll find in your institutions, nor in your government, nor in any education. It’s lacking wisdom completely. And to have wisdom, according to these Freudian people, is that you are egoistical! They have such funny ideas from the yarn of Mr. Freud that no sensible man would accept. But people have lost their senses, and like blotting paper, whatever is filthy, destructive, horrible, subhuman they try to absorb. Supposed to be Christian nation.\n",
    "Please, all Sahaja Yogis must understand: You must get hold of books and find out, where are we? I worked very hard in France, you know that very well. I used to think, this is the gate of hell. But it is much worse than that, it’s a mire of filth and you are born here and you have become like lotuses, so fragrant and beautiful. You’ll have to fight it out: I am always with you, all My powers with you. But remember that you have to fight the society, you have to save so many people, you have to rescue them.\n",
    "Children are given liberty, “Do what you like.” They have no sense of liberty! Supposing there’s an aeroplane, which was not fixed properly and made to fly. What will happen to the aeroplane? If the children are given liberty without the right sense of their duty and the right sense about themselves, what will happen to them? Why children are born to parents? It is – to get spoiled, to have liberty or to get some guidance? You cannot guide your children. They are so rude, they are so arrogant. They have gone off, completely. You know for one month we had to struggle with these western children and we had come to the point of urge of closing down that school because they were really violent children, as if coming from some jungle. Even the jungle animals have some sense. So you’ve to think about your children. What’s going to happen to your children? What is going to be their situation? If they are going to live in the same manner in this dirt, these children will turn out to be waste, just a waste! They will have no education, no character, no personality, they’ll end up with AIDS or with drugs or something like that. I do not see any future for the children of France, no future.\n",
    "And you have to fight that, “We want to have future for our children, we don’t want them to be ruined.” And you must have courage, to fight it. It’s very important to have courage. If you do not have the courage, you cannot fight it. And today’s Puja is to give that courage in your hearts. See it all around you, what’s happening? You are all nicely enjoying yourself in the realm of God, (Shri Mataji smiling) you have entered into the Kingdom of God. But what about the rest of the people? The majority of the people, where are they going? What is going to be the future of this horrible Mooladhara place?\n",
    "Now Freud has been discovered as a fraudulent man, and now there are books after so many years, when he has already ruined the people all over the world. But the worst of all they have ruined here.\n",
    "It’s a responsibility specially of the women I think, because they are responsible for the society. The society of France has gone to dogs and for you to now take up upon yourself to talk against this kind of anarchy that is working out the destruction of your families. If the women decide, I am sure, they can very, very easily work it out. Instead of asking for liberation nonsensical, you better ask for the ascent of this country.\n",
    "I know I’ve worked very hard and you are all there. I am very happy to see that you all are there to fulfill the desires of the Divine. Because now you should know in a very big way, masses of masses of people will be destroyed. Not from without but from within. Suddenly you’ll hear so many millions disappear with this disease.\n",
    "Also you must protect yourself, all of you: always give yourself a bandhan; always lead a clean life. There are certain hygienic rules of Sahaja Yoga, please try to follow them. Do not neglect it. If somebody gets AIDS, you’ll not have him in Sahaja Yoga, whatever may be the conditions, whatever may be the reason. You have to be very careful, also I would say never treat a AIDS patient. Like the one yesterday who was arguing with Me, actually because they have only two types of people: one who are arrogant and another one which always think that it’s better they should die. They have no will to live. So there are only two types of people, either right-sided or left-sided. And they can never ascend. We have tried, we have tried, of course one first one is living for the last seven years, but still. He has no faith in himself. Maybe next generation might be better on, if they come back. But as far as this generation is concerned, you should know your responsibility is very great. All the Sahaja Yogis must take a vow that they’ll fight this society and try to save their country and their countrymen from a complete disaster. There is going to be no war, only they will fight themselves and die. It’s a very serious matter.\n",
    "For that, we decided to have this Puja of Durga today that all negativity should be destroyed. So many Deities build up the body of Kali. Every part of Her body was created by a Deity, looked after by a Deity, and is also, later on, is reflected in you all. So they say that God has made human beings in His own image, I would say, I’ve made you in My own image, all the Deities at your disposal. They’re all with you, and they have created you – if you see it minutely – it is the Deities who have brought forth all the beauty that you had. They have made all this beautiful congregation, beautiful transformation, and they have created such angelic people out of you. They are always working it out, but one thing you have to do is to have the drive. You had pure desire to ascend, but for what? You want to have the light, but for what? You want to become gurus, for what? To save people, for their salvation. Only through your channels I can work out Sahaja Yoga. If I could work out Myself, I would have. It’s not question of killing one rakshasa. God knows how many there are, rakshasas and rakshasas. And they are everywhere, even within you they were. Now they’ve gone out.\n",
    "So you have to do full justice to Sahaja Yoga, that’s very important. I knew the puja would be very late, because Kali’s puja is always done in the night, after twelve. So it had to be this way. Though last night I slept at four o’clock and I, tonight, I don’t know what am I to do, – it all works out. It’s all worked out. But you have to have deliberations and you have to think, “What can we do to change this?” Why not write some books, why not write some experiences? Get them published in French only. Let the French know what’s happening outside. Get some of the books translated – some American books, some English books. At least give quotations from there. How they are unaware. First this Catholic church has to go away. It will, no doubt, I am sure about it. They are literally frightened of us.\n",
    "And we have to now really show them what we are capable of. And the funniest thing is that a president has chosen his lady-friend as the prime minister. I mean, it’s not possible in any sensible country. It’s never heard of. I must say, English are thousand times better. They are really very good. At least, as far as administration is concerned, as far as their parliament is concerned, the justice is not stupid like this, it’s based on law, not based on the mood of a magistrate. How you are still continuing with such stupidity which are really even before medieval age: primitive, people are absolutely primitive to accept such laws. At least you can write a book about the strange laws of French, one title. How it has harmed. There is a very nice book “Fraudulent Freud”. Please read that, and see how Freud has ruined the French, how their brains are twisted, how they have twisted ideas. You are also intelligent, clever people. So if not with the sword, Kali has to work through the pen.\n",
    "I never knew it was in that bad shape, though I knew it was. So this is a challenge for all of us, and let Me see what you can write, all of you – put together your experience: how the French parents behave, how the grandparents behave, what’s happening in this country and all that.\n",
    "They are living in fool’s paradise. They don’t know how destruction is just hanging over their heads.\n",
    "Though you are all saved, but you have to think of others, that is what Sahaja Yoga is, that is not only that we care for the bhaktas – like Kali just wanted to protect the bhaktas, the sadhakas. But you have to protect many, many more people. You have all the powers, just assume them and use them. You can do it. Your media is the worst of all and we can start the newspaper also calling it anti-media. What can they do to us? Or some sort of an independent name, we can give it. And it should be open for people who are suffering from media sensationalization. They can write: how the media is harming them, how they are giving false reports and things. We can! Why not? I am sure it will work out. Think it over what you can do with your pen. Whatever you have gained, whatever you are enjoying: beautiful music, all the Pujas, everything. But think of others. They are already drunk and tossing their heads on their pillows. Think of them. They, when will they feel this joy? I simply feel pity for them that they should have taken to all these bad things, because of the suppression of the Catholic church. It’s the Catholic church which has suppressed them, that’s why they have come to this. No other way – reason why they should accept this kind of thing.\n",
    "In Sahaja Yoga, we do not do all these things, we’re in the centre. We do not have this kind of problems, because we don’t suppress anyone, nor do we go to the other extreme of indulgences. I think the whole Europe can be divided into two types of people: one are Anglo-Saxons, and others are Latins. Anglo-Saxons are right-sided and the Latins are left-sided: they cry, weep, miserable, they indulge into dirt and filth. Just these two types they are. Now unluckily you are in the Latin side. So here, Catholic church is prospering. Now, if you see to the Latin side and understand to what extent they have gone to the left side, and getting to the left side what diseases you get, very nicely, make a list of them. So what I said will work out in France: the left-sided incurable diseases. As it is, you walk on the street, you find at least three, four mad people, lunatic people walking, you’ll find. Very simple it is. Don’t have to go to the lunatic asylum, on the street! They’ll be all talking and saying things, but it’s all there. That’s why they drink, that’s why they are miserable. I do not know what are the statistics of the diseases.\n",
    "So the problem is extremely grave, very grave. And you have to work it out, with the gravity of your gurupada which you have asked Me the other day – you asked for the status of a guru, for ladies as well as for men. And I said, “All right, start!”\n",
    "I hope you all have heard the song I’ve made, for asking.\n",
    "[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]\n",
    "All right once they will sing that song.\n",
    "[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]\n",
    "They will sing that song to you. There are different request from the Mother, and in this the last one is that: “Mother, now you give us the gurupada, the status of a guru.” But every guru has a duty: to cleanse the society in which he lives. It’s his duty, he has to fight it. Christ fought it alone, so many saints fought it alone, they were treated very badly, put in jail, given poisons, things, but they fought it. In the same way you stand on Truth, and you have to fight it. Because you are saints.\n",
    "May God bless you!\n",
    "[Yogis sing: “Vinati Suniye Adishakti Meri”. Shri Mataji speaks aside in Marathi]\n",
    "They’ll repeat it twice, so you can also. I don’t think all of you have heard it, because those who came to Guru Puja must have.'''"

       "'Diwali Puja. Hampstead (London), 9 November 1980\\n\\n...English, in the sense that we sat down together and translated Sanskrit pujas into English and tried to make it more understandable by human beings.\\n\\nIt\\'s the day of Mahalakshmi Puja night, not only of Lakshmi Puja; there\\'s a difference between the two.\\xa0 Mahalakshmi is one of the powers of the three powers, main powers of Adi Shakti. As you know: Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali.\\xa0 Now these powers have powers at a material level also, at a subtler level also.\\xa0 So Mahalakshmi power is achieved after Lakshmi Power, as you know.\\xa0 So the Lakshmi... there are eight powers of Lakshmi.\\n\\nThis Lakshmi was born or came out of the sea, the great sea, which was churned thousands and thousands of years back.\\xa0 And She came out of the sea because She is the daughter of the sea.\\xa0 That\\'s why She\\'s called as Neeraja.\\xa0\\xa0 \"Neera\" means \"water\" and \"ja\" means \"born out of.\"\\xa0 This has happened thousands and thousand years back that She was born.\\xa0 So what is that?\\xa0 What is this Lakshmi... see symbolically, what is it expressing?\\xa0 It is expressing the awareness.\\xa0 Lakshmi expresses awareness, and She came out of the sea, you know that; the awareness first started growing in the sea.\\xa0 The life started existing in the sea, to begin with, and then it grew out.\\xa0 Without the life there is no awareness.\\xa0 First the life, because everything is jaDa[ed. \"jaDa\" definition: void of life , inanimate , unintelligent], everything is dead, and when it becomes life it means it has awareness.\\xa0 So the awareness started growing in the sea.\\n\\nThis is the symbolic expression. In the gross level you can understand this way.\\xa0 But actually the subtle level, it is the other way round.\\xa0 But because we see things from the gross level, we say that \"that is symbolic,\"\\xa0 but actually from the other side if you say, \"this is symbolic.\"\\xa0 Do you understand this point?\\xa0 So for Me it is symbolic to see how the life came into being in the sea and that it became aware.\\xa0 For Me it is symbolic and for you it is symbolic the other way round.\\xa0 I mean if I see something from this side, I see the... this way and while you see from that side you see this way.\\xa0 Do you understand this? If you want to paint something on a glass, how do you paint it on the glass?\\xa0 Have you any idea?\\xa0 You start painting first the outermost things that you have to paint.\\xa0 For example if you are painting the Goddess, first you will paint Her ornaments, then Her sari, then Her body. Like that it will be moving deeper from this side, if you are painting it on the glass, because you have to see it from the other side.\\xa0 But supposing you have to paint it on a canvas, you\\'ll paint it the other way round.\\xa0 You first paint the body, then the sari and then the ornaments.\\xa0 So to one thing it is symbolic because they think this goes from their angle, to the other person who is from the other angle this is absolutely symbolic.\\xa0 And surprising that everything is so symbolic and so much just the same, that whatever you may say, the subtle remains subtle and the gross remains gross.\\xa0 The one who is at the subtle level sees the gross as a symbolic expression of his subtle attention.\\n\\nNow She was born in the sea.\\xa0 She was called as \"Neeraja.\"\\xa0 Or... or \"Neera,\" that means \"water.\"\\xa0 My name is - one of them is Nira as you know; out of Nirmala one name is Nira, Neema and Neela, like that I\\'ve got three names, four names I should say the big one is Nirmala.\\xa0 So this Nira part means what, that She was born in the sea, that... the name of Mary is also the same.\\xa0 Miriam or Mary, I don\\'t know how you say in English, but Maria comes from Marie, the word Mari.\\xa0 Mari itself comes from the word Meri.\\xa0 So this Mahalakshmi, Mary is named, and She is, because She was born in the sea and that\\'s how Her name was Mary.\\xa0 Mariana they call Her, some people call Her Mariana, sometime call Her Miriam.\\xa0\\xa0 All these words are indicating that She was born in the sea.\\xa0 So She is Mahalakshmi. Now Mary is Mahalakshmi and Ganesha is the child.\\xa0 Now see how symbolically it works, that only in Diwali the Lakshmi and the Ganesha are worshipped, only these two personalities.\\xa0 Can you understand that?\\n\\nThe symbol of Mahalakshmi for Me is Mary, for you it is Mahalakshmi is the symbol.\\xa0 And the symbol of Ganesha outside is Christ; He is symbolising Ganesha.\\xa0 So, both of them are worshipped only on Diwali.\\xa0 Actually this is the Christmas. This is the real Christmas that was before also, and this was the time baby Christ was born, not the 25th of December.\\xa0 Though it\\'s a misunderstanding, doesn\\'t matter, keep it up. Doesn\\'t matter, whenever He\\'s born, because there used to be a very big festival, and after the festival He was born, called as Valaanan. I don\\'t know what you call in modern times, that time it was called like that. And then this child was born and that was the time Christmas was celebrated.\\xa0 It was just tallying with that, but somehow it shifted, I don\\'t know how, how it shifted. And there might be somewhere you\\'ll find out that real Christmas was shifted.\\n\\nYogi: Yes it is, that\\'s known.\\n\\nShri Mataji:\\xa0 [aside: ALL RIGHT?] And symbolically in this lifetime also, in the Kali Yuga also same thing happened that Mahalakshmi and Ganesha were born, and that\\'s why they are worshipped.\\xa0 Now you ask anyone, why Ganesha and Mahalakshmi are worshipped, after all, on a Diwali?\\xa0 And it was the darkest night.\\xa0 It was the darkest night, and that night a star was there.\\xa0 And because it was such a dark night that star was very much noticed by everyone.\\xa0 It was cold night, very cold night and a dark night.\\xa0 So the symbol of Diwali is very great for Sahaj Yoga.\\n\\nFirst of all you have to know there are four days that are celebrated in Diwali, but there is one more day added to it in Maharashtra.\\xa0 The first day of Diwali is called as \"Dhanatrayodashi,\" is the thirteenth day of the moon.\\xa0 Because that day is the first day when Lakshmi, the first... was born on the thirteenth day.\\xa0\\xa0 That means She was born as a Gruha Lakshmi, as a housewife.\\xa0 Now there are eight Lakshmis, which she will read it now and I will tell you later on what is the meaning of them. Just one of them is Gruha Lakshmi.\\xa0\\xa0 So the first is the form of a Gruha Lakshmi.\\xa0 She is born as a Gruha Lakshmi to begin with.\\xa0 That means the awareness of human beings also, started really getting into evolutionary process when they started their family life.\\xa0 When they were vagabonds moving about, then the awareness was just like animals.\\xa0 Though they had become human beings, but they were like animals.\\xa0 Then when they established their families, then the Gruha Lakshmi started working and that\\'s how the first advent of Gruha Lakshmi was felt.\\xa0 So She is the first Lakshmi who was born, and that\\'s why on that thirteenth day is the day of the Gruha Lakshmi, of the housewife.\\xa0 And so one has to go in the market and buy some utensil or something that she uses for cooking in the house.\\xa0 In India on the thirteenth day everyone goes and buys a pot or say... we can say, what you call, a cooking utensil or something.\\xa0 Or they may buy a sari or something or gold or something for the Gruha Lakshmi.\\xa0 That is the day of the housewife.\\xa0 So, to reach the Lakshmi one has to understand that motherhood is very important.\\xa0 The motherhood as a Gruha Lakshmi is important.\\n\\nAnd the second day is even more important, because Narakasura was killed. Horrible Narakasura as you know him.\\xa0 But actually that day many rakshasas are killed in many... That\\'s the day fixed for killing rakshasas.\\xa0 And then they are put in the hell; on the fourteenth day they are put in the hell.\\xa0 So that\\'s called as Naraka Chaturdashi, that is the day when the hell is opened out.\\xa0 That day Sahaja Yogis are supposed to sleep in the night while everybody does all kinds of tantrikavidya and all that on the fourteenth.\\n\\nThen the fifteenth is that darkest night, that\\'s the darkest night when there is no moon.\\xa0 Absolutely that\\'s the day when they celebrate the Diwali.\\xa0 But symbolically in India also, Shri Rama returned to Dwari- to his [PLACE?] on that day and was crowned on that day.\\xa0 So the significance of Diwali is expressed in this manner, that this is the day when Narakasura, with all of them are killed, they have all gone to Narak, they have gone to the hell, and the people now are safe from them and they are celebrating the joy.\\xa0 And that is the time when Christ was born.\\xa0 That\\'s why lights are lit just in the night, \\'cause He was born at twelve o\\'clock in the night.\\n\\nSo the next day to that is the day is celebrated in India only in Maharashtra.\\xa0 I don\\'t know people celebrate otherwise I don\\'t know. Do you celebrate?\\n\\nYogi: I don\\'t know.\\n\\nShri Mataji: Makes no difference.\\xa0 That\\'s the first day of the moon.\\xa0 That is the forefather of your Mother, Shalivahana; they started a calendar, from that date.\\xa0 And so on the first, that means the first day of the moon, the New Year is celebrated.\\xa0 Now see symbolically if Christ is born and the New Year is celebrated, next day.\\xa0 As soon as He is born New Year starts.\\xa0 So next year it starts: the New Year.\\xa0 That is a New Year in many parts of our country where Shalivahana lived.\\xa0 The Shalivahan was my forefather, I should say they were My... they were just a dynasty.\\xa0 And this dynasty ruled in India since very long.\\xa0 Even in the old puranas it is written that they helped Krishna in their war.\\xa0 You know all the story about Shalivahana quite a lot.\\xa0 And so the New Year started.\\xa0 So for us, that is the New Year, for Sahaj Yogis that is the New Year, you have to accept it.\\xa0 And your Mother is of that dynasty.\\xa0 I mean no force on you, but if you like you can have it.\\n\\nThen the second day is also very important.\\xa0 Is the second day is the moon, that is the moon came out of the sea.\\xa0 According to this mythology, the Lakshmi came out of the sea and with Her this moon came out, which was only a two-day-old moon, the new moon but a two-day-old moon, and this was regarded as the brother of Lakshmi, because they were born at the same time from the sea.\\xa0 So He is the brother of Lakshmi.\\xa0 It\\'s all symbolic; this is very, very symbolic.\\xa0 Now you see the left side is... left side you know is that of... belongs to Mahakali, and a brother had to be on this side, on the left side.\\xa0 But actually you\\'ll be amazed that He is the brother of Lakshmi.\\xa0 He is not a brother of Mahakali.\\xa0 But because He\\'s the brother of Lakshmi he is accepted as the brother of all the goddesses, one brother for all of them.\\xa0 So He is the only brother who is this moon, so He is your uncle, He is your maternal uncle.\\xa0 It\\'s very interesting, because we have a special right on our maternal uncle, we can always ask for His help.\\xa0 And it\\'s a big story about this churning that took place that Shiva saw all the poison also coming out.\\xa0 So He drank the poison because He\\'s the only one who could drink the poison.\\xa0 And He got so heated up in His head, in His neck that He wanted something to cool Him.\\xa0 So He took to this moon and put it on His head.\\xa0 So the crowning is the moon.\\xa0 Now if you see it... on Monday is the day of Sahastrara.\\xa0 Monday is the day of the Moon.\\xa0 Monday is the day of Sahastrara. it\\xa0 Sadashiva has put it on His head.\\xa0 And that\\'s what people tease you that, \"your brother-inlaw is sitting on your head.\"\\xa0 It\\'s very good.\\xa0 You see it\\'s very symbolic - for you, not for Me, but for you - that the brother-in-law is sitting on the head.\\n\\nThis brother-in-law is very important, and if brother-in-law is in any way angry then even Sadashiva has to think twice.\\xa0 Normally special relationship, which is very sweet and which is very expressive.\\xa0 And if you want to understand it, that your brother-in-law - is a naughty little thing - is the brother of the wife - if you have to keep your wife pleased, that is the power, you have to keep the brother-in-law quite happy.\\xa0 So He said is better to keep him on [you- DEL] His head.\\xa0 He set Him up there.\\xa0 If there\\'s a naughty child, what do you do to a naughty child?\\xa0 You put him out somewhere there so he doesn\\'t move.\\xa0 All of you take a child outside you put him out there.\\xa0 And He is very dear to Sadashiva, really loves Him in a special way, and that day is the day when all the sisters worship their brothers, very important.\\xa0 Raksha Bandhan Day they give a symbolic expression to their desire that their brother should be good.\\xa0 But on this day they worship their brothers, actually worship them.\\xa0 They are invited at home, they are made to sit on the special type of a seat, then they are... also Aarti is done to them.\\xa0 Sometimes if they are very small younger brothers then they are even given baths nicely.\\xa0 If they are older brothers also they\\'ll cover all their body, but water will be poured on them as a symbol and they are given new dresses to wear, and very special food is cooked that day.\\xa0 And then they are served special food ahead of their husbands.\\xa0 Always husband is served first, but that day the brother gets the food first, and then the brother-in-law is teased a lot.\\xa0 And the younger brother-in-law teases his sister\\'s husband and it\\'s a very nice function.\\xa0 It\\'s called as bhau-beej. And that day the Brother gives something to the Sister as a present.\\xa0 You may give even if you don\\'t have anything, you can give a\\xa0 big thing, whatever it is.\\xa0 But you give something as a symbol of your love to your... sister. And this day, today, is that.\\xa0 It\\'s such a nice day to do.\\xa0 This is the day when we all be just together. But for a Gruha Lakshmi, the brother is very important.\\xa0 And the brotherhood and sisterhood is the base of our Sahaj Yoga collectivity.\\n\\nIf you understand... that brotherhood and sisterhood is love which is very pure.\\xa0 There is no expectation, it\\'s just love, is giving love and taking love.\\xa0 And absolute purity within us should exist between our relationships when we call them as Sahaj Yogi brothers and sisters.\\xa0 And as there is understanding, complete understanding between the brother and sister in a family, one has to know we are all part and parcel of a family, born of the same Mother.\\xa0 Nobody has to shoot off - war; nobody has to become something great, nobody has to correct others, nobody has to say that \"I\\'m something unique.\"\\xa0 All of you have to work it out together and find out the solution working out together in complete friendship and unison.\\xa0 Anyone who cuts off himself and goes out or becomes anything else, goes out of circulation and useless for Sahaj Yoga.\\xa0 Such a person is completely useless: the one who tries to get out of the family.\\xa0 All of you have to be supporting each other, helping to each other, not shouting at each other and getting angry with each other, trusting each other, not finding faults, treating each other with respect and love.\\n\\nThis is the most important thing if Sahaj Yogis don\\'t understand that you are saints and you have to respect it.\\xa0 For example, you cannot doubt each other, you cannot, that\\'s not allowed, it\\'s prohibited.\\xa0 You are not to doubt each other.\\xa0 Be aware, I would say that if somebody slaps you on one cheek, turn the other.\\xa0 That you work out here.\\xa0 In this Sahaj Yoga one has to do it, not to criticise anyone, not to put down anyone.\\xa0 You are all Saints, why don\\'t you recognise it?\\xa0 How can you insult a saint?\\xa0 You are \"Men of God,\" do you realise that?\\xa0 How can you put down anyone and say \"they are not good\" and \"they are good\"?\\xa0 If you start doing that, somebody else will take advantage of you and will really push you down and you will be in very great trouble.\\xa0 Never get into such funny ideas, that you are better than the others, that you can do better than the others.\\xa0 The one who starts doing the better is doing the greatest harm.\\xa0 There is no competition in Sahaj Yoga.\\xa0 Give up this idea of competition.\\xa0 You are brothers and sisters, you have to support each other, help each other.\\xa0 Anybody is going down, try to work out.\\xa0 If you find somebody\\'s going down too much beat him with shoes.\\xa0 But anybody who thinks he is very great, he has this speciality or that quality... Supposing somebody thinks he\\'s very neat, he should hang himself by the nearest tree.\\xa0 That\\'s what I sometimes feel because on this point there are so many quarrels going on.\\xa0 But somebody who thinks he has a right to be untidy also should hang himself by the nearest tree and should know that I\\'m making an example of myself to others.\\xa0 You must respect; if there is no mutual respect, this brother and sister relationship is nothing.\\xa0\\xa0 It\\'s a very sweet relationship which you have not enjoyed unfortunately, but in India we have.\\xa0 Our brothers will give up their lives for us and we will give our lives for our brothers.\\xa0 And our brothers have so much faith in us that if we tell them that \"you should not do this\" they know that this we are doing it only just to help him out, not to show off our great importance or giving a big sermon but it is just because we love.\\xa0 The love is so established and if that love is not established, what are we showing off about?\\n\\nToday is, in a way very great, is of brothers and sisters.\\xa0\\xa0 How do you express your brothers\\' and sisters\\' relationship?\\xa0 I do not like to hear complaints, but I see that it is full of\\xa0 The reason being, people are behaving in such a manner that I cannot understand that you are saints what has happened to you?\\xa0 How can you be individualistic?\\n\\nI\\'ll give you a simple example.\\xa0 We have got in our house some sort of plant, which could only grow inside the house, but when it was summertime, we put them outside and they were growing well.\\xa0 But when the winter came in suddenly one night they all became very... absolutely dead you can call it.\\n\\nSo, the servant got upset he said, \"What to do now?\"\\n\\nI said, \"You bring them in.\"\\n\\nNow he said, \"They won\\'t grow.\"\\n\\nI said, \"Bring it.\"\\xa0 I said, \"You get four five of them, put them together in one.\"\\xa0\\xa0 And they started growing well. Because whatever is missing in one person is support from the another person.\\xa0 And the support is so natural and spontaneous which flows. If you try to correct others then you are draining out your energy and the energy of another person, just try to support them.\\xa0 That\\'s how it works out and that\\'s how it sustains, it\\'s nourishing.\\xa0 I mean it\\'s an experiment you can try also, at home.\\xa0 If you put four five trees together when they are in delicate condition they grow better.\\xa0 Why, when we grow our saplings we put them together?\\xa0 Why don\\'t we put them separate?\\xa0 See: when we have got a small seed and we have to make them into saplings, we never put them separately we put them together, in a small block.\\xa0 If you put them separately they will never come up.\\xa0 Then they are kept in that condition together, till they grow. When they are grown, then only they are taken from that collective group and put them separately.\\xa0 Have you not seen this happening?\\xa0 And this is what is collectivity.\\n\\nAt the delicate point when Sahaj Yoga is coming up, you have to be much more closer together.\\xa0 Later on when you are very powerful it\\'s all right because you will have greater rapport.\\xa0 But it\\'s such a vicious circle that at this time when you are weak you are also falling off.\\xa0 And this collectivity is all embracing. Of course these are due to your ego, superego, whatever problems, but only together you are going to be...\\xa0 But I have seen when you are mesmerised, you following\\xa0 again ego, absolutely.\\xa0 When you are mesmerised.\\xa0 But when there is freedom, you cannot enjoy your collectivity.\\xa0 In freedom people find it very difficult to- then somebody behaves like an ascetic, some behaves like a madcap, somebody behaves like an hot-tempered fellow, another behaves like a sitting consul,\\xa0 I don\\'t know. When it is freedom you do not grow in a healthy way together.\\xa0 You must know there must be something within you which is keeping you out of collectivity.\\xa0 At this stage the best thing is to surrender and beat yourself with shoes.\\xa0 Any such ideas come into your head you just do that way, that\\'s the way it will work out.\\n\\nToday is the day you have to promise, today, here.\\n\\nWhere is Cooly?

I mean you need not be serious people at all because Sahaj Yoga is not a serious thing, it is a play.\\xa0 It is a play of grace.\\xa0 You have to be but gracious; you are not to be disgraceful, that\\'s very important.\\xa0 If you are disgraceful, then your vidya is useless.\\xa0 I have seen many people all the time doing like this, doing like that; they think that if their left hand... jaw... see?\\xa0 They have become now masters of this.\\xa0 There\\'s no grace about it.\\xa0 One has to see how to do it graciously.\\xa0 We see your Mother, how She moves Her hands and fingers.\\xa0 Not one day is- one time, even in one action you will find Me doing something unrespectable now...

Bho-gya – “Bhogya”-means “the one by which you enjoy, by which you enjoy.” I mean it’s like the whole ocean of joy is around you and you are like a bird who cannot drink it. Only through the grace of Bhoga Lakshmi, Bhogya Lakshmi, you can enjoy that ocean. So the Spirit, though it is manifesting, you are not enjoying yourself. Even that, anything that you see- say, see a flower, you should be able to enjoy. You cannot enjoy because there is thought. Anything you do, there is thought, you cannot enjoy. When the Spirit is flowing, you get complete enjoyment. Actually I should say, I am the enjoyer.\\nEveryone: Om twameva Sakshat, Shri Bhogya Lakshmi Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagawati Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi, Namoh Namaha. Yogini: “Om Twameva Sakshat Shri Yogi [mistake] Lakshmi Namah.\\nShri Mataji: Yoga Lakshmi.\\nThe Lakshmi’s power which gives you Yoga. Lakshmi supports your power of yoga by giving you awareness. The power by which you take to Yoga is all combined as Yoga Lakshmi. Like your affluence, you are not satisfied and you want to have Yoga. The dissatisfaction you get till you have got Yoga is coming from the Yoga Lakshmi. So Yoga Lakshmi means the power which gives you or takes you to your grace, by which you go to Yoga, that’s Yoga Lakshmi. Means the kind of a satisfaction that you seek, is manifested in you through this power of Yoga Lakshmi. And then once you have achieved your yoga, you get the grace. Lakshmi is the grace. So you get the grace of a saint. You should have the grace of a saint. You should look like a saint; you are a saint. I think better write it on your mirrors, “We are saints. We are ‘Men of God.’ We have to behave like saints. We are saints.” You are. No doubt. You are ‘Men of God,’ no doubt, but you have turn your faces in this way. So, this is the Yoga Lakshmi. For example a person who has got Yoga Lakshmi doesn’t quarrel like a madcap. If he quarrels or dominates someone in a foolish way then he’s still lacking that Lakshmi point. There’s a grace about it: whole way of talking and – how you talk to a saint?\\nAll right.\\nEveryone: Om twameva Sakshat, Shri Yoga Lakshmi Sakshat, Shri Adi Shakti Sakshat, Shri Bhagawati Sakshat, Shri Mataji, Shri Nirmala Devi Namoh Namaha.\\nShri Mataji: So these are the eight-fold paths by which one has to grace oneself. This is the attire of such. And today you have asked for it.\\nMay God give you that power.\\n\\nOne more thing I have to say just before we start with the thing, that around the Lakshmi you know is the Void. And though the Lakshmi in a situation where there is negativity, runs away, She is frightened, She is a frightened Deity. But She doesn’t, She is very sensitive. She doesn’t like any negativity; as soon as the negativity comes in She runs away. In the same way these people, those people, those great saints who were born on the Void, have said that, “Those people who try to frighten Lakshmi are the people who are irreligious,” in the sense they drink. Those people who drink, in the third generation lose their Lakshmi completely. You can see the results now; those who used to take one peg [30ml of alcohol] now are sitting in the pub the whole night. And that’s what it is, that once these things enter into your family or household, they start corroding your Lakshmi.\\nThat’s why we have to understand that Lakshmi is very, very sensitive to this [deity?], and Lakshmi is extremely sensitive to fanaticism, extremely sensitive to fanaticism. Any kind of fanatic ideas you have got, She will run away. She can’t stand fanaticism. As soon as fanaticism will settle down into any country, it will start becoming poorer and poorer. Any kind of fanaticism about religion is to be avoided. Nowadays so many young people who are aware of fanaticism because, thank God, there are some horrible fanatics, which have proved that fanaticism is bad, and they are now coming down. But when fanaticism works out, the expulsion of all the powers of Lakshmi from within, that’s a sure and certain sign that you really invite cancer, really invite cancer, also alcohol does, but this is the triggering point, if an alcoholic is as well as a fanatic, it will trigger much faster. Fanaticism is to be to be avoided like leprosy for Sahaja Yogis, but not only that, we have to stand up in a revolt against all kinds of fanaticism. Just this is the revolution against all fanaticism of life. That’s very important for the establishment of Shri Lakshmi. Any religion, any fanaticism that collides with another religion or in any way belittles – because all religions are just the same of one God – belittles another religion or insults anyone, is absolutely against Lakshmi’s Principle. So we go… after all this, when we rise above this, we go to Mahalakshmi principle. Now the awareness that was seeking up to Lakshmi, means you achieve money, achieve position for achieving Grace, once you have achieved the Grace of this, you want to achieve God. And this new awakening within you that you have to achieve God now, is the power of Mahalakshmi. By the power of Mahalakshmi only, you achieve your saintliness, your Realisation. That’s why She came on this earth as the Mother of Jesus Christ. That was Mahalakshmi, not Lakshmi but Mahalakshmi.\\nMay God bless you.\\n\\n[Some conversation in Hindi, English and again Hindi.] ..\\n\\nGavin:\\xa0 gurushaya Namaha.
